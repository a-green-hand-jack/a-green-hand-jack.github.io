# 📖 Education

- *Sept.2021 – June 2025*: B.Sc. in Biotechnology, Department of Life Sciences and Medicine, University of Science and Technology of China (expected)
- *Sept.2018 – June 2021*: [<span style="color:#41555d;">The Middle School Attached To Northwestern Polytechnical University</span>](http://www.xgdfz.com/)

# 🧪 Research Experience

## 💻 Hierarchical Transformer for Genomics
**Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Dr. Zijun Zhang** \\
**UC Berkeley, Prof. Wuyang Chen** \\
*Remote (US)* \\
**Research Assistant** (03/2024 – 08/2024)
- This project focuses on the application of deep learning techniques, particularly hierarchical transformers, to uncover hidden patterns in DNA sequences. By integrating both global and local DNA information, we aim to enhance the model's ability to better understand and predict complex genetic structures.
- Specifically, I focused on improving model performance by devising a method that balances the global context of entire DNA sequences with localized, detailed genomic information. This allows for more accurate predictions of genetic functions and structures, potentially aiding in biomedical research.
- By this project, I had a better understanding of LLMS and konwn how to use Huggingface and some other deeplearning toolboxes.

## 🖥 Training-free Design of Data-centric Augmentations with Principles
**UC Berkeley, Prof. Wuyang Chen** \\
*Remote (Canada)* \\
**Research Assistant** (06/2023 – 02/2024)
- Developed a training-free framework that evaluates the effectiveness of various image augmentation techniques on deep learning models, particularly in the context of medical imaging datasets.
- Investigated the relationship between data covariance properties and image recognition accuracy, providing insights into how certain augmentations could be leveraged to improve model robustness without the need for extensive retraining.
- Our work demonstrated that these augmentation methods could substantially improve the efficiency and accuracy of medical image analysis, especially for under-represented or noisy datasets. [<span style="color:#41555d;">This research</span>](https://openreview.net/forum?id=kmAdBRaShI) was published in the ICML 2024 Workshop AI4Science.

## 🐀 Isolation of Bacteriophages Targeting Gut Bacteria
**University of Science and Technology of China, Prof. Yi Duan** \\
*Hefei, China* \\
**Research Assistant** (01/2023 – 05/2024)
- Developed an innovative \textit{in vitro} culture system for \textit{Akkermansia muciniphila} (Akk), a key gut bacterium. Our system was contamination-free, specifically addressing the issue of \textit{Cutibacterium acnes} contamination that plagued earlier methods.
- Isolated and purified Akk-targeting bacteriophages from wastewater samples. Following multiple rounds of amplification, we constructed a phage library that serves as a toolkit for selectively targeting Akk populations in the gut microbiome.
- This phage library provides a crucial resource for studying Akk’s role in various diseases, offering potential applications for targeted microbiome manipulation in therapeutic contexts. This project received an outstanding rating as a school-level research initiative.

## 🦟 Biodegradable Needles for Transdermal Delivery in Biofilm-Infected Chronic Wounds
**Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research, Prof. Xiaorong Xu** \\
*Suzhou, China* \\
**Research Assistant** (11/2022 – 09/2023)
- Designed biodegradable long microneedles inspired by the mouthparts of insects like mosquitoes and ticks. These needles are intended for the treatment of deep tissue infections caused by biofilm-forming bacteria.
- Utilized finite element simulation software (COMSOL and Abaqus) to optimize the needle's design, focusing on material properties and geometric configurations that could penetrate deep skin layers while maintaining structural flexibility.
- Introduced a novel injection molding technique for economically producing these complex needle structures. This project was highly rated and received recognition as an outstanding school-level project.

## 🦠 Isolation and Identification of Cyanobacteria and Cyanophages from Lake Chaohu
**Laboratory of Biochemistry & Structural Biology, Prof. Congzhao Zhou** \\
*Hefei, China* \\
**Research Assistant** (09/2022 – 06/2023)
- Successfully isolated three strains of cyanobacteria and their corresponding cyanophages from water samples collected from Lake Chaohu.
- Conducted genomic analysis on the isolated cyanobacteria, determining their taxonomic classification and evaluating their ecological roles within the lake’s ecosystem.
- This research won an award at the National University Life Science Competition, highlighting its significance in advancing our understanding of freshwater microbiomes and their interaction with phages.
