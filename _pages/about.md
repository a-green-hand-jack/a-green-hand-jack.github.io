# üìñ Educations
- *Sept.2021---June 2025*ÔºöB.Sc. in Biotechnology,Department of Life Sciences and Medicine,University of Science and Technology of China (expected)
- *Sept.2018---June 2021*:[<span style="color:#41555d;">The Middle School Attached To Northwestern Polytechnical University</span>](http://www.xgdfz.com/)

# üß™ Research Experience

## üíª Hierarchical transformer for genomics
**Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Dr.Zijun Zhang**

**UC Berkeley, Dr.Wuyang Chen**

*US (remote)*

**Research Assistant** (03/2024 -- present)
- Investigating Concealed Information within DNA Sequences using Deep Learning.
- Exploring how to enhance the model's perception of DNA information by integrating the global and local information of DNA sequences.

## üñ• Training-free Design of Data-centric Augmentations with Principles
**UC Berkeley, Dr.Wuyang Chen**

*Canada (remote)*

**Research Assistant** (06/2023 -- 02/2024)
- Explored the influence of various image augmentation methods on the recognition accuracy of common deep learning networks.
- Explored the relationship between data covariance properties and image recognition accuracy.
- Summarized the evaluation of various image augmentation methods on different medical imaging datasets.

## üêÄ Isolation of bacteriophages targeting gut bacteria
**University of Science and Technology of China, Prof.Yi Duan**

*China*

**Research Assistant** (01/2023-- 05/2024)
- This study has successfully established an in vitro culture system for $\textit{Akkermansia muciniphila}$ (Akk), free from contamination by $\textit{Cutibacterium acnes}$. Notably, the culture system developed in our study is simpler, more user-friendly, and less susceptible to contamination compared to any previously reported systems. 
- Additionally, we have successfully isolated phages targeting Akk from wastewater samples and have conducted multiple rounds of purification and amplification.
- The phage library constructed in this study for Akk can serve as a phage technology or tool for the specific knockdown or knockout of Akk populations within the gut. This enables further investigation into the mechanisms of action of Akk in the gut in relation to various diseases. This represents the significance of our research topic.
- Furthermore, we can construct phage libraries targeting other gut microbiota, thereby providing technical support for other studies related to gut microbiome research.
- This project was rated as an excellent school-level project that year.

## ü¶ü Biodegradable needles for transdermal delivery in biofilm-infected chronic wounds
**Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research, Prof.Xiaorong Xu**

*China*

**Research Assistant** (11/2022 -- 09/2023)
- Proficiency in finite element simulation software (COMSOL and Abaqus) for conducting simulation tasks.
  - Utilized Abaqus to simulate the process of needle insertion into the skin.
  - Utilized COMSOL to optimize material selection and the geometric shape of the needle.
- Designed a long needle for the treatment of deep-seated tissue infections.
  - The design of this long needle was inspired by the mouthparts structure of insects such as mosquitoes and ticks.
  - This long needle inherits the advantages of microneedles and compensates for their limitations in terms of depth.
- Introduced a novel injection molding method for the cost-effective and convenient production of long or microneedles with complex geometrical structures.
 - A heterogeneous model that allows simultaneous consideration of needle puncture strength and structural flexibility.
- This project was rated as an excellent school-level project that year.
  



## ü¶† Isolation and identification of cyanobacteria and cyanophages from Lake Chaohu 
**Laboratory of Biochemistry & Structural Biology, Prof.Congzhao Zhou**

*China*

**Research Assistant** (09/2022 -- 06/2023)
- Studied fundamentals and principles of bioinformatics, with a focus on genome analysis techniques.
- Successfully isolated three strains of cyanobacteria from Lake Chaohu water samples.
- Conducted a genomic analysis of these three cyanobacteria strains, thereby determining their taxonomic classification.
- Isolated some cyanophages from Lake Chaohu water samples using these isolated cyanobacteria strains.
- Thanks to this work, we received an award at the National University Life Science Competition in the same year.
