# üìñ Educations
- *Sept.2021---June 2025*ÔºöB.Sc. in Biotechnology,Department of Life Sciences and Medicine,University of Science and Technology of China (expected)
- *Sept.2018---June 2021*:The Middle School Attached To Northwestern Polytechnical University

# üß™ Research Experience

## üñ• Research on benign overfitting in computer vision.
**UC Berkeley, Dr.Wuyang Chen**
*Canada*

**Research Assistant** (06/2023 -- present)
- Exploring the Influence of Various Image Augmentation Methods on the Recognition Accuracy of Common Deep Learning Networks.
- Exploring the Relationship between Data Covariance Properties and Image Recognition Accuracy.
- Summarizing the Evaluation of Various Image Augmentation Methods on Different Medical Imaging Datasets.

## üêÄ Isolation of bacteriophages targeting gut bacteria
**University of Science and Technology of China, Prof.Yi Duan**
*China*

**Research Assistant** (01/2023-- present)
- Learning techniques related to animal experiments.
- Learning basic biochemical laboratory techniques.

## ü¶ü Biodegradable needles for transdermal delivery in biofilm-infected chronic wounds
**Suzhou Institute for Advanced Research, Prof.Xiaorong Xu**
*China*

**Research Assistant** (11/2022 -- 09/2023)
- Proficiency in finite element simulation software (Comsol and Abaqus) for conducting simulation tasks.
  - Utilized Abaqus to simulate the process of needle insertion into the skin.
  - Utilized Comsol to optimize material selection and the geometric shape of the needle.
- Designed a long-needle for the treatment of deep-seated tissue infections.
  - The design of this long needle was inspired by the mouthparts structure of insects such as mosquitoes and ticks.
  - This long needle inherits the advantages of microneedles and compensates for their limitations in terms of depth.
- Introduced a novel injection molding method for the cost-effective and convenient production of long or microneedles with complex geometrical structures.
  - A heterogeneous model that allows simultaneous consideration of needle puncture strength and structural flexibility.

## ü¶† Isolation and identification of cyanobacteria and cyanophages from Lake Chaohu 
**Laboratory of Biochemistry & Structural Biology, Prof.Congzhao Zhou**
*China*

**Research Assistant** (09/2022 -- 06/2023)
- Studied fundamentals and principles of bioinformatics, with a focus on genome analysis techniques.
- Successfully isolated three strains of cyanobacteria from Chaohu Lake water samples.
- Conducted a genomic analysis of these three cyanobacteria strains, thereby determining their taxonomic classification.
- Isolated some cyanophages from Chaohu Lake water samples using these isolated cyanobacteria strains.
- Observed the morphology of these cyanophages under an electron microscope.
- Thanks to this work, we received an award at the National University Life Science Competition in the same year.
